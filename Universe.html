the Moon looks from earth over about a month. As the 
Moons orbits around the earth,the half of the Moon that 
faces the sun will be lit up. The different shapes of the 
lit portion of the Moon that can be seen from earth are 
known as phases of the Moon. Each phases repeats 
itself in every 29.5 days. 
●  A new Moon is when the Moon can not be seen 
because we are looking at the half of the Moon. A 
new Moon occurs when the Moon is directly 
between the earth and sun.  
●  Gibbous Moon is occurs when 3/4 portion of the 
Moon is visible from the earth.  
●  A full Moon is occurs when we can see the entire 
lit portion of the Moon. The full Moon phase 
occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of 
the earth from the sun.</div>
